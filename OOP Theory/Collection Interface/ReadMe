  Classes
   i. ArrayList: It is a dynamic array for sorting elements.
      Features of ArrayList:
        i. It can contains duplicate elements.
       ii. It maintain insertion order.
      iii. It allow random access.
   
   Syntax to create ArrayList: 
         ArrayList<Data-Type> arrayList_name = new ArrayList<Data-Type>();
         
         
         
  ii. LinkedList: It uses doubly linked list to store elements.
      Features of LinkedList:
        i. It can contains duplicate elements.
       ii. It maintain insertion order.
      iii. Manipulation is fast because no shifting need to occur.
