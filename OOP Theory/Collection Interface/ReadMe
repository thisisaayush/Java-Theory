  Collection Interface: It is the interface which is implemented by all the classes in the collection framework.
  
  Collection interfaces here are like List, Set, Queue, Deque.
  Collection classes here are like ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, Vector, PriorityQueue.
  
  Classes
  #. List
   i. ArrayList: It is a dynamic array for sorting elements.
      Features of ArrayList:
        i. It can contains duplicate elements.
       ii. It maintain insertion order.
      iii. It allow random access.
   
   Syntax to create ArrayList: 
         ArrayList<Data-Type> arrayList_name = new ArrayList<Data-Type>();
         
         
         
  ii. LinkedList: It uses doubly linked list to store elements.
      Features of LinkedList:
        i. It can contains duplicate elements.
       ii. It maintain insertion order.
      iii. Manipulation is fast because no shifting need to occur. 
      
    Syntax to create ArrayList: 
         LinkedList<Data-Type> linkedList_name = new LinkedList<Data-Type>();
         
         
   a. Difference between ArrayList and LinkedList:
                        ArrayList            |          LinkedList
             i. It is dynamic array to store |  i. It is doubly linked list to store
                elements.                    |     elements.
            ii. It is better for storing and | ii. It is better for manipulating data.
                accessing data.              | 
            
   1. ListIterator interface: It is used to travese the elements in a backward and forward direction.
      Syntax: ListIterator<data-type> iteratorName = List_Name.listIterator();
     
  #. Set
    i. HashSet: It is used to create a collection that uses a hash table for storage.
    Hashing: HashSet stores elements using a mechanism called hashing.
