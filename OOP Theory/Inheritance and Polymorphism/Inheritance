  Inheritance: It is a concept in Java OOP which allows to inherit the attributes and methods from one class to another class.
  Inheritance has two categories:
  i. Parent Class (sub-class): It is a class that is being inherited from.
 ii. Child Class (super-class): It is a class that inherits the parent class.
 
  Note: Inheritance represents "Is- A relationship" and to inherit properties of a parent class, child class has to use "extends" keyword.
  
  a. Why multiple inheritance is not possible?
   - Multiple inheritance is not possible to reduce the complexity. For instance, we have 3 classes, A, B, and C. Class C inherits a method 
     lets say, speed(). If class A and B both has method speed(). Compiler will not understand which method to call from those two classes 
     and will create compiler error.
