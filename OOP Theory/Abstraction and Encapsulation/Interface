  Interface: It is a blueprint that can be used to implement a class. It doesn't contain any concrete methods.
  That means method doesn't have a body.
  
  Note: Inorder to access interfaces methods, the interface must be implemented by another class with the 
  "implements" keyword.
  
  Question:
  How can we do multiple interface but not multiple inheritance?
