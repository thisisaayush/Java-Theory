  Abstraction: It is the process of hiding implementing details and showing essential information to user. 
  For instance: a driver doesn't need to know all the internal functioning of the car. He just need to know
  the external functioning of the car, so that he/she could drive.
  
  Note: Abstraction can be achieved with either abstact classes or interfaces.
  
  abstract keyword: It is a non-access modifier which is used for classes and methods.
  
  i. abstract class: abstract class can't be used to creat the object. It can be inherited and to access it,
  it must be inherited. Note: final class can't be inherited.
  
  ii. abstract method: abstract method is only used in abstract class. It cannot have a body. Body of abstract 
  method is provided by a child class.
  
  Point to Remember:
  i. An abstract class is declared with abstract keyword.
 ii. An abstract class can have both abstract and non-abstract methods.
iii. An abstract class cannot be instantiated. A child class is used to instantiate it.
 iv. An abstract class can have constructors and static and final methods.
