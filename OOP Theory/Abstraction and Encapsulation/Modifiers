Modifiers
There are two types of modifiers in Java and they are:
a. Access Modifiers: It controls the access level
b. Non- Access Modifiers: It doesn't coltrol the access level, but provides other functionality.

Access Modifiers: 
  i. public: access level is everywhere (within and outside of class/packages).
 ii. private: access level is only within the class. It can't be accessed from outside the class.
iii. protected: access level is within a package and outside a pacakage through child class.
 iv. default: access level is only within a package. If no access leve is defined, it will be default access modifier.
 
Non- Access Modifiers:
  i. final: 
    a. variables: value of it can't be changed once assigned.
    b. methods: it can't be overridden.
    c. class: it can't be inherited.
 ii. abstract:
    a. methods: It can't have a body. Body is implemented by a subclass.
    b. class: It contains abstract as well as concrete methods. The class cannot be used to create objects
    (To access an abstract class, it must be inherited from another class).
    
    Some other non-access modifiers are static, transient, synchronized, volatile.
