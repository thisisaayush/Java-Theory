Encapsulation: It is a mechanism of wrapping the data and code acting on data together as a single unit.
It is also called Data Hiding. It make sure sensitive datas are hidden from users.

  To achieve encapsulation:
  a. Declare class variables/attributes as private.
  b. Provide public get and set methods to access and update the value of private variables.
 
Note: The get method returns variables value and the set method sets the value.
