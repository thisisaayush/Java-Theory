    Collection: It s a group of individual objects represented as a single unit. It is used to store and manipulate the group of objects.
    
    Hierarchy of Collection Frame work:
      i. Set
     ii. List
    iii. Queue
     iv. Dequeue
     
     
     Map: It doesn't implement collection interface.
     
     i. Set
        Features of Set interface: 
          i. It doesn't allow duplicates.
         ii. Elements are not ordered (TreeSet implements sorted set).
        iii. Examples of set: HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet
        
    ii. List
        Features of List interface:
          i. It can contains duplicates.
         ii. Elements are ordered.
        iii. Examples of list: ArrayList, LinkedList
        
   iii. Queue
        Features of Queue interface:
          i. It follows FIFO- First In First Out- principle, except for PriorityQueue where 
             elements are processed based on priority.
             
    iv. Deque
        Features of Deque interface: 
          i. It is called Double Ended Queue because elements can be inserted and removed at
             both ends. That means, it allows both LIFO and FIFO principle.
             
     #. Map
        Features of Map interface:
          i. It can key value pairs.
         ii. It doesn't allow duplicates.
        iii. Examples: HashMap, TreeMap (implements Sorted Map)
        
    Note: Set has only keys whereas Map has key value pairs.
