    String: It is an object that represents sequence of character.
    
    String class provides a lot of methods to perform operations on string such as compare(), concat(),
    equals(), replace(), length(), etc.
    
    CharSequence Interface: It represents the sequence of characters. String, StringBuffer, StringBuilder classes 
    implements it.
    
    Note: 
    Java String is immutable. It means it cannot be changed. 
    
    There are two ways to create String object in Java:
     i. By string literal It is created using double quote. 
        Example: String obj1 = "Hello";
    ii. By new keyword: In this case, JVM will create a new string object in normal (non-pool) heap memeory.
        Example: String obj2 = new String("Hello");
