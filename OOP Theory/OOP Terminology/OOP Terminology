Object Oriented Programming Language(OOP)
List of Terminology in OOP:
1. Objects      2. Class      3. Inheritance      4. Polymorphism     5. Abstraction      6. Encapsulation
7. Coupling     8. Cohesion   9. Association     10. Aggregation     11. Composition

Advantages of OOP:
  i. Provides data hiding property.
 ii. Development and maintance of codes are easier.
 
Objects: It is defined as any entity that has state and behavior. Example: dog, pen.
a. State of an object: It tells the properties of an object. Example: a dog has different properties such as
   breed, color, etc.
b. Behavior of an object: It is defined by methods of an object. Example: a dog barks, sleeps, so this barks(), 
   sleeps() are the behavior of a dog.
c. Identity of an object: It gives a unique name to an object. Example: a dog can have a name.

Properties of an object:
  i. It is an instance of a class.
 ii. It is a real world entity and a run-time entity.
 
Class: It is a blueprint for creating an object.
Note: A class has:
  i. Instance variables.
 ii. Methods.
iii. Constructors.

Method: It is a set of code which has a name and can be invoked at any point in a program by using its name.
Advantage of method:
   i. Code reusability.
  ii. Code optimization.
  
 Constructor: It is a special method used to initialize an object. It is called when an object of a class is created.
 Types of constructors:
   i. No- argument constructor: If a constructor doesn't have any argument, it's known as no- argument constructor. 
      It can be called default constructor.
  ii. Parametrized constructor: If a constructor has any argument, it's known as paremeterized constructor. It provides 
      different values to different constructor.
  
 Difference between Constructor and Method:
   
                    Constructor                 |                  Methods
   a.    It is used to initialize the state of  |  a.   It is used to expose the behavior of 
         an object.                             |       an object
   b.    It doesn't have return type.           |  b.   It has a return type.
   c.    Its name must be same as class name.   |  c.   Its name may or may not be same as a class name.
         
         
  Does constructor return any value?
  Yes, it returns current class instance. But it doesn't return any type.
